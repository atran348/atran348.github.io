        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Andrew Tran is a dedicated and inquisitive biology student with a fervent interest in exploring the intricate workings of the living world. Hailing from the bustling city of Los Angeles, California, Andrew's journey into the realm of biology began with a childhood spent marveling at the diversity of life in his urban surroundings.

Throughout his academic tenure at Coastal University, Andrew has distinguished himself as a diligent scholar and an enthusiastic participant in extracurricular activities. His coursework has delved deeply into various branches of biology, from genetics to ecology, as he seeks to unravel the mysteries of life at every scale.

Andrew's passion for hands-on learning led him to actively seek out opportunities to apply his knowledge in real-world settings. During his sophomore year, he volunteered at a local marine research institute, where he assisted scientists in studying the ecological dynamics of coastal ecosystems. From collecting water samples to analyzing data on marine biodiversity, Andrew relished the opportunity to contribute to meaningful research that has the potential to inform conservation efforts.

Eager to expand his horizons beyond the shores of California, Andrew pursued a summer internship at a renowned botanical garden in the Pacific Northwest. Here, he immersed himself in the study of plant physiology and conservation, working alongside experts to propagate endangered species and develop strategies for sustainable horticulture. Andrew's time at the botanical garden not only deepened his understanding of plant biology but also ignited a newfound appreciation for the critical role that plants play in supporting life on Earth.

In addition to his academic pursuits, Andrew has been actively involved in student organizations dedicated to promoting scientific inquiry and environmental stewardship. As a member of the university's Ecology Club, he helped organize community clean-up events and educational workshops aimed at raising awareness about local conservation issues. Andrew's leadership and commitment to environmental advocacy have earned him the respect and admiration of his peers, inspiring others to join him in the fight to protect our planet's natural resources.

Looking ahead, Andrew is excited to embark on his next academic and professional endeavors. With a strong foundation in biology and a wealth of practical experience under his belt, he aspires to pursue a career at the intersection of research and conservation, where he can contribute to efforts aimed at safeguarding Earth's biodiversity for future generations.

Driven by his insatiable curiosity and unwavering dedication to environmental stewardship, Andrew Tran is poised to make a meaningful impact in the field of biology and beyond.<br><br>
